## Food Truck API

A sample AspNetCore API application that allows the consumer of the API to:

- Add a new food truck.
- Retrieve a food truck by `locationid` field.
- Get all food trucks for a given `block`.

The API is configured with Swagger UI for easy testing.
Clone the repo and start the solution.
